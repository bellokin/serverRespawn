## Usage

To use the `server-respawn` package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx server-respawn <target-file>
```

Replace `<target-file>` with the path to the file you want to monitor. This command will start watching the specified file for changes and automatically restart the server whenever the file is modified.

This should be clear for users to understand how to use your package in their projects.
